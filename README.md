# MalWorkz
A Reinforcement Learning Engine for Bypassing Machine Learning Classifiers

## Overview
MalWorkz is a reinforcment learning engine that attempts to bypass machine learning classifers by manipulating a Portable Executable (PE) file through a set of 6 distinct methods.  Works with x32 PE/.NET/.dll files and with a variety of file formats such as UPX or MSI.  The 6 different obfuscation techniques utilized in this engine are 
1.  Header Randomization
2.  Code Cave Creation
3.  AddressOfEntryPoint Section Encryption
4.  Section Addition
5.  Section Renaming
6.  PE Signing.  

## Setup
Python version `3.6` <b>MUST</b> be used.  

Install the `requirements.txt` file in a python virtual environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Unzip `models.zip`

Install Windows `SignTool`.  This tool is used for signing PE files.  The MalWorkz engine will use `SignTool` in conjuction with a supplied `.pfx` file.  After `SignTool` is installed add the location to Windows system environment varibles so that the program may call it.
