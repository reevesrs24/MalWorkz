## Overview
MalWorkz is a reinforcment learning engine that attempts to bypass machine learning classifers by manipulating a Portable Executable (PE) file through a set of 6 distinct methods.  Works with x32 PE/.NET/.dll files and with a variety of file formats such as UPX or MSI.  

## Setup
Python version `3.6` <b>MUST</b> be used.
